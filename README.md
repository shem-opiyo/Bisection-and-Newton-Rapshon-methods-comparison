The code compares the runtime of bisection method and newton raphson method, when finding the root of  x^4 + x^3-2x^2+x-18. It starts 
by describing the elements used by methods for the comparison. These inlcude describing the function to be used, the function's derivative, 
the range i.e. 'a' and 'b', initial starting point i.e. Xo, and maximum number of iterations i.e. 100 iterations.
The code then starts by implementing the bisection method and noting the time taken to find the root of the function. It then implements 
newton-raphson method and notes the time taken to find the function's root, then compares the runtime of both methods. Finally, the code identifies the 
method with the shortest time taken to find the root of the function and displays it.
